# Compliance Management and Governance Platform for RTOs

## Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive, modular compliance management system for Registered Training Organizations (RTOs). The system centralizes governance, training, feedback, compliance tracking, and resource management into one platform.

---

## 1. Core Modules & Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Governance
- Manage and store policies, procedures, and compliance documentation.
- Track financial compliance, child safety, leadership fit and proper tests, workforce adequacy, and insurance documentation.
- Support continuous improvement workflows with version control and audit history.
- Role-based permissions for editing and reviewing policies.
- Integration with Google Drive for document storage and linking.

### 1.2 Training Product Management
- Link training products to associated SOPs, validation reports, and instructional materials.
- Map assessment strategies and schedules for each training product.
- Support both accredited and non-accredited training.
- AI analysis to identify misalignments or outdated materials.

### 1.3 Feedback Management
- **Learner Feedback:** Collect via surveys (JotForm) by trainer, course, or learner type.

- **Auto-Reminders:** Schedule compliance renewals, PD expirations, and document reviews.
- **Smart Workflows:** Conditional logic for forms (e.g., training type triggers relevant SOP).
- **Predictive Insights:** Forecast compliance gaps or risks based on feedback and training trends.

---

## 4. User Experience
- Portal interface for staff with personalized dashboards.
- Dynamic navigation by role (trainer, admin, leadership).
- Search and filter across all modules (resources, policies, training).
- Embedded JotForm and internal forms for feedback and submissions.
- Consistent branding and responsive design for desktop and mobile.

---

## 5. Security & Permissions
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for users and departments.

- Encrypted data storage for PII and compliance evidence.

---

## 6. Future Features (Scalable Roadmap)
- AI compliance auditor for proactive alerts.
- Predictive staff training recommendations.
- Self-service employer and auditor portals.
- ChatGPT integration for document Q&A (policy search assistant).
- Data visualizations for compliance trends and performance metrics.

---

## 7. Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js) + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js / FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM or Supabase)
- **Automation:** n8n or Temporal for workflows
- **Analytics:** Grafana + Prometheus
- **AI Layer:** OpenAI API or Azure Cognitive Services
- **Hosting:** AWS / Vercel / GCP (depending on integration needs)

---

## 8. Example User Stories
- As an **admin**, I want to see which compliance standards are not yet mapped to any policy so I can fill the gaps.
- As a **trainer**, I need to complete and sign SOP training via JotForm and see my progress dashboard.
- As a **manager**, I want to monitor PD completion rates and compliance metrics across departments.
- As a **compliance officer**, I need automated alerts when any credential or insurance is about to expire.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria (per Module)

### 10.1 Governance
- **Create/Update Policy**: Given a user with `ComplianceAdmin` role, when they upload or link a policy (PDF/Doc), then the system stores metadata (title, version, owner, review date) and version history, and the policy is searchable within 5 seconds.
- **Version Control**: When a policy is superseded, the system preserves prior versions and marks only one version as `Current` at any time.
- **Standards Mapping**: A policy can be mapped to ≥1 compliance standards; dashboard immediately reflects counts of mapped/unmapped items.
- **Access Control**: Users without `ComplianceAdmin` can view `Published` policies but cannot edit; attempts are logged.
- **Review Workflow**: Policies with review dates in ≤30 days appear in a `Due for Review` queue and notify owners daily until resolved.

### 10.2 Training Product Management
- **Linking**: A training product record must include links to SOPs, validation docs, and assessment strategy. Missing links flag the product as `Incomplete`.
- **Schedule**: Trainers assigned to a product see due training tasks on their dashboard within 60 seconds of assignment.
- **Audit Trail**: All edits (who/when/what) are visible in the product’s history tab.

### 10.3 Feedback Management
- **Ingestion**: Completing a JotForm survey triggers a webhook; data is persisted within 3 seconds and visible in the `Feedback` table.
- **Anonymity**: If the submitter opts out of identification, PII fields are not stored; analytics still aggregates results.
- **AI Insights**: Daily job produces sentiment score (–1..1) and top 5 themes for the last 30/90 days with precision/recall ≥0.7 on test set.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter feedback by course, trainer, employer type, date range; results return in <2 seconds for up to 10k records.

### 10.4 Professional Development (PD)
- **Credential Tracking**: Each credential has an issue date and expiry; system calculates next due date and shows `Due` (≤30 days) and `Overdue` states.
- **Completion Evidence**: Submitting PD via form attaches proof (file/link); record becomes `Verified` only after manager approval.
- **Notifications**: Daily digest email/WhatsApp-compatible webhook to each staff member and manager for items due in the next 7/30 days.

### 10.5 Resource Management
- **Asset Lifecycle**: Create, assign, service, retire states must be supported; servicing schedule creates tasks automatically by time or usage metric.
- **Evidence**: Upload service reports and invoices; assets show `Compliant` only if last service ≤ scheduled interval.

### 10.6 Complaints & Appeals
- **Workflow**: Statuses = `New` → `In Review` → `Actioned` → `Closed`; each transition requires notes. SLA breach flags if `New` not moved within 2 business days.
- **Linkage**: Complaint records can be linked to policies, staff, and training sessions; closure requires root cause and corrective action.

### 10.7 Compliance Tracking & Mapping
- **Coverage**: Standards catalog maintained; dashboard shows % mapped to policies, SOPs, training, and evidence.
- **Gaps Report**: Export CSV/PDF within 10 seconds for up to 500 standards-to-evidence links.

### 10.8 HR & Onboarding
- **Sync**: Xero/Accelerate sync runs daily (and on demand) and creates/updates staff records; duplicates resolved via email or external ID.
- **Onboarding Pack**: New staff automatically receive assigned SOP/PD forms based on department/role; completion tracked.
- **Permissions**: Department membership determines visible forms and modules; changes reflect on next login.

### 10.9 Performance & Security (Cross-cutting)
- **Latency**: 95th percentile API response <500 ms for typical queries; background jobs can exceed.
- **Availability**: 99.5% monthly uptime (excluding planned maintenance).
- **Security**: RBAC enforced on every endpoint; PII at rest encrypted; all changes audit-logged.
